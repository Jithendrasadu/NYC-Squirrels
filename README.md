# NYC Squirrels Data Analysis

## Overview

This project involves an exploratory data analysis of the NYC Squirrels dataset, which captures various aspects of squirrel populations in New York City. The primary objective was to uncover insights regarding the behavior and characteristics of squirrels across different neighborhoods.

## Libraries Used

The following R libraries were utilized in this project:

- **dplyr**: For data manipulation and transformation.
- **ggplot2**: To create visualizations of the data.
- **tidyr**: For tidying the dataset.
- **lubridate**: To work with date and time data.
- **readr**: For reading CSV files.

## Analysis and Findings

1. **Data Exploration**:
   - Imported the dataset and examined its structure, including the variables present (e.g., squirrel ID, location, fur color, and behavior).
   - Cleaned the data by handling missing values and ensuring the dataset was tidy for analysis.

2. **Behavioral Insights**:
   - Analyzed the frequency of various behaviors exhibited by squirrels (e.g., foraging, climbing, etc.) and identified which behaviors were most common across different areas.

3. **Geographical Distribution**:
   - Mapped the locations of squirrel sightings using ggplot2, visualizing how squirrel populations are distributed across NYC neighborhoods.

4. **Fur Color Analysis**:
   - Examined the fur color distribution among squirrels, revealing interesting trends and preferences based on location.

5. **Seasonal Trends**:
   - Investigated any seasonal patterns in squirrel activity, correlating behavior with time of year to determine if certain behaviors are more prevalent during specific seasons.

## Conclusion

This project highlights the fascinating behavior of NYC squirrels, showcasing how they interact with their environment and how these interactions vary across neighborhoods. The insights gained from this analysis can contribute to understanding urban wildlife dynamics and inform future wildlife management strategies.
